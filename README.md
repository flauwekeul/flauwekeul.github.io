## Development

This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a **user site**. This means the root of the `master` branch must contain the build artifacts. Development is done on the `develop` branch. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the site to production. See `deploy.sh` to see what happens.
